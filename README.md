Make an image bounce on your desktop


This is literally all it does. Read through my lunatic comments if you want to know more.

Setup:

- Clone repository or download file
- create a venv with ```python -m venv .venv``` or smth
- create a folder called ```img``` where you will put the image you want to bounce around
- rename the image to ```we_bounce``` and make sure its either jpg, gif, or png
- install pystray and pillow inside your environment
- run main.py
- close from the system tray icon

Have fun!
